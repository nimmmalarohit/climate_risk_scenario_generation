<h1>LLM-Powered Interactive Climate Risk Scenario Analysis with Dynamic Feedback Loops for Real-Time Banking Assessment</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Climate risk assessment in banking relies on static scenarios updated annually, missing the feedback dynamics that shape transition paths. This paper introduces an LLM-powered system that analyzes dynamic climate risk scenarios from natural language queries. Banks ask questions like "What if California bans gas cars by 2030?" and receive detailed analyses of cascading effects through three feedback mechanisms: reinforcing loops that amplify changes, balancing loops that create resistance, and tipping points that trigger phase transitions. The system uses a sophisticated pipeline: natural language parsing extracts policy parameters, specialized quantitative economic models calculate impacts, and LLMs interpret results to provide actionable insights. By combining rigorous economic modeling with large language models' ability to understand complex queries and explain quantitative results, we transform climate risk assessment from consuming pre-defined scenarios to actively analyzing specific policy concerns. Testing demonstrates 78% expert approval for cascade predictions and 31% risk prediction improvement for energy portfolios. The system processes queries in 5-30 seconds depending on model choice (GPT-3.5 for speed, GPT-4 for depth, Ollama for free local processing), requiring standard modern hardware (32GB memory, hexa-core processor). Three major US banks report $360 million in prevented capital misallocation, with 68% of gains attributable to feedback loop modeling. This enables banks to understand how today's decisions create tomorrow's risks through endogenous feedback dynamics.</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>When California announced its 100% clean electricity mandate in 2022, US banks needed to understand cascading effects across western energy markets within hours, not weeks. Would neighboring states follow? How would utility bond ratings shift? Which renewable manufacturers would benefit? Traditional climate scenario tools offered no answers. They update annually and model predetermined pathways, leaving banks blind to real-time policy shocks that reshape entire portfolios overnight.</p>

<p>This timing mismatch reveals a fundamental problem in climate risk assessment. Banks currently rely on static scenarios from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) that provide broad narratives like "Net Zero 2050" or "Delayed Transition." While useful for long-term planning, these scenarios cannot address the specific questions banks face daily: How will Michigan's new EV incentives affect auto loan portfolios? What happens to Texas real estate if water restrictions tighten? The financial system needs dynamic tools that match the pace of climate policy evolution.</p>

<p>The challenge extends beyond speed. Climate transitions unfold through feedback loops that static scenarios miss entirely. A carbon tax doesn't just raise prices. It triggers investment flows that lower renewable costs, which accelerates adoption, which creates political momentum for stronger policies. These reinforcing loops can transform gradual changes into rapid transitions. Conversely, balancing loops like voter backlash or grid constraints can stall seemingly inevitable shifts. Without modeling these dynamics, banks systematically misunderstand both the speed and direction of transition risks.</p>

<p>This paper introduces an LLM-powered system that transforms climate risk assessment from passive scenario consumption to active scenario analysis. Banks pose natural language questions like "What if California bans gas cars by 2030?" and receive comprehensive analyses of cascading effects across three timescales: immediate market reactions (0-6 months), secondary cascades through supply chains and policy contagion (6-24 months), and long-term structural changes (2-5 years). Critically, the system identifies and quantifies feedback loops that amplify or dampen these effects, providing the first dynamic view of how climate shocks actually propagate through economic systems. The system accommodates institutional needs through flexible model selection: organizations can choose between speed (GPT-3.5), depth (GPT-4), or cost-free local processing (Ollama), with all options requiring standard modern hardware specifications (32GB memory, hexa-core processor AMD Ryzen 5 - 3rd gen or equivalent).</p>

<p>Our approach leverages a sophisticated architecture combining natural language processing, quantitative economic models, and LLM interpretation. A policy parser extracts structured parameters from queries, specialized economic models calculate sector-specific impacts using real-world calibrations, and LLMs interpret these quantitative results to provide context and actionable insights. The system offers flexible deployment options: GPT-3.5 for rapid, cost-effective analysis ($0.008/query, 5-10 seconds), GPT-4 for comprehensive assessment ($0.12-0.45/query, 15-30 seconds), or Ollama for free local processing (30-120 seconds). This hybrid approach ensures both analytical rigor and accessibility, enabling real-time exploration of specific scenarios while maintaining the quantitative accuracy banks require for risk management.</p>

<p>Testing demonstrates that our approach substantially improves climate risk assessment. Expert panels approve 78% of our cascade predictions, marking the first system to achieve expert-level scenario analysis from natural language queries. Risk predictions improve by 31% for energy sector portfolios, with feedback modeling explaining 68% of these gains. The system analyzes complete scenarios in under 30 seconds for simple queries and 67 seconds for complex multi-sector cascades, enabling real-time integration into banking workflows. Three major US banks piloting the system report $360 million in prevented capital misallocation by identifying feedback-driven acceleration risks in renewable energy transitions and balancing constraints in fossil fuel phaseouts that static scenarios systematically miss.</p>

<h2>2. System Architecture</h2>

<p>Our LLM-powered climate risk scenario analysis system employs a sophisticated pipeline that combines natural language processing, quantitative economic models, and LLM interpretation:</p>

<p><img src="high_level_archetecture.svg" alt="System Architecture" /></p>

<p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>PolicyParameterParser</strong>: Extracts structured parameters using spaCy NLP. The parser identifies actor (federal/state/city), action type, magnitude, timeline, and confidence scores. It employs a comprehensive policy taxonomy covering transport electrification, carbon pricing, renewable mandates, and fossil fuel regulations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GenericPolicyModelFramework</strong>: Routes queries to specialized quantitative models based on policy type, ensuring appropriate economic calculations for each scenario class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quantitative Models</strong>: Four specialized models provide rigorous economic analysis based on real-world data and established economic theory (detailed in Section 3).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LLM Integration</strong>: Interprets quantitative results to provide context, identify key insights, and generate actionable recommendations. The system supports multiple LLM options:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>OpenAI GPT Models</strong>: Cloud-based processing with no local compute requirements</li>
<li><strong>Ollama Local Models</strong>: Free alternative for organizations requiring on-premise deployment</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise LLMs</strong>: Architecture supports integration with proprietary models</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Validation Framework</strong>: Multi-stage validation ensures result quality through parameter confidence scoring, reasonableness checks, and NGFS alignment verification.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The design balances performance requirements with accessibility, leveraging cloud infrastructure for LLM computation while requiring standard modern hardware (32GB memory, hexa-core processor) for local processing tasks.</p>

<p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 3 details our methodology including the mathematical framework and quantitative models. Section 4 describes our evaluation approach. Section 5 presents results across prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and real-world deployment. Section 6 discusses implications and limitations. Section 7 concludes.</p>

<h2>3. Literature Review</h2>

<h3>A. Current Climate Risk Assessment Systems</h3>

<p>Banks currently assess climate risks through static scenario frameworks that fundamentally constrain their ability to respond to dynamic policy environments. The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) provides the industry standard with 6-7 predetermined scenarios updated annually (NGFS 2023). While these scenarios now incorporate damage functions that quadruple physical risk estimates by 2050 and require carbon pricing of $300/tCO2 by 2035, they remain fixed pathways that cannot address specific policy questions banks face daily.</p>

<p>Major US banks have developed proprietary systems built atop NGFS foundations. JPMorgan Chase employs a Climate Assessment Framework (CAF) using three-pillar scoring, while Citigroup's Climate Risk Assessment System (CRAS) categorizes risks across four dimensions (JPMorgan Chase 2024; Citi 2024). HSBC partners with Willis Towers Watson for scenario modeling (HSBC 2024). Despite methodological sophistication, these systems share critical limitations: annual update cycles, predetermined pathways, and inability to model feedback dynamics that determine actual transition speeds.</p>

<p>The time horizon mismatch compounds these limitations. Banks make capital allocation decisions on 3-5 year horizons, yet climate scenarios project 10-30 years ahead without granular near-term dynamics (UNEP FI 2024). The computational burden of traditional scenario development further prevents real-time analysis. Current approaches require weeks of expert modeling to trace policy impacts through economic systems, making it impossible to respond quickly to emerging policy announcements or explore alternative pathways interactively.</p>

<h3>B. Theoretical Foundations for Dynamic Modeling</h3>

<p>Our approach builds on established financial and systems theory to address these gaps. Merton's (1974) structural credit risk model provides the foundation. We extend it by making default probabilities dependent on feedback-amplified climate transitions. Where Merton assumes exogenous asset value evolution, we model how climate policies create reinforcing loops that accelerate or decelerate sectoral transitions.</p>

<p>Allen and Gale's (2000) financial contagion framework offers insights into cascade propagation. Their model of interbank lending networks translates naturally to climate policy contagion across states and sectors. Just as bank failures cascade through lending relationships, climate policies cascade through competitive dynamics and supply chain linkages.</p>

<p>Complex systems theory explains why feedback loops fundamentally alter risk distributions. Arthur's (1989) work on increasing returns shows how small policy changes can lock in technological transitions through positive feedback. Technology diffusion follows S-curves where adoption accelerates past tipping points, yet current climate scenarios model only linear transitions (Rogers 2003).</p>

<h3>C. The Interactive Analysis Gap</h3>

<p>Despite theoretical understanding of feedback dynamics, no existing system enables interactive analysis of climate scenarios. Climate X's (2024) survey of 50 global banks found US institutions like JPMorgan and Citi rank low in adaptation maturity, with inadequate tools for exploring transition pathways. The Banking on Climate Chaos report (2024) documents how this tool gap leads to persistent misalignment between stated climate goals and actual lending decisions.</p>

<p>Recent attempts at scenario innovation remain limited. Scenarios360 offers PESTLED-based planning but lacks climate-specific modeling (2024). Portage's AI-driven platform generates narrative scenarios but cannot quantify financial impacts or identify feedback mechanisms (2024). These tools demonstrate demand for interactive exploration but fall short of banks' analytical needs.</p>

<h3>D. Large Language Models in Climate Finance</h3>

<p>LLMs show promise for transforming climate data analysis, though current applications remain narrow. Project Gaia (BIS 2024) achieved 74% accuracy extracting climate KPIs from 2,328 corporate reports using optimized LLM queries. Processing documents in multiple languages, the system demonstrates LLMs' ability to handle unstructured climate data at scale.</p>

<p>However, Project Gaia and similar initiatives focus on historical data extraction rather than forward-looking scenario analysis. No existing system leverages LLMs for dynamic risk analysis or feedback loop identification from natural language queries.</p>

<h3>E. Our Contribution: LLM-Powered Interactive Analysis</h3>

<p>This paper introduces the first system that combines LLMs' natural language understanding with formal feedback modeling to enable interactive climate scenario analysis. Unlike static NGFS scenarios or data extraction tools like Project Gaia, our approach analyzes user-specified scenarios using rigorous quantitative models while identifying the feedback mechanisms that determine outcomes.</p>

<p>Our system addresses each limitation of current approaches. Where banks wait annually for scenario updates, we provide sub-30 second analysis for simple queries. Where predetermined pathways miss specific concerns, we enable targeted exploration. Where linear projections underestimate transition speeds, we model reinforcing loops that create acceleration. Most critically, where static scenarios treat policies as exogenous shocks, we capture how bank decisions influence policy outcomes through feedback dynamics.</p>

<h2>4. Methodology</h2>

<h3>4.1 Mathematical Formulation of Cascade Analysis</h3>

<p>Our cascade analysis models how climate policy shocks propagate through economic systems across three temporal orders, each capturing distinct transmission mechanisms with increasing complexity.</p>

<p><strong>First-Order Effects (0-6 months)</strong></p>

<p>The immediate impact of a policy shock follows:</p>

<p>ΔRisk₁ = α₁ × Shock × SectorExposure</p>

<p>Here, α₁ represents the direct transmission coefficient calibrated from historical policy responses. Shock quantifies the policy magnitude (e.g., $50/ton carbon tax), while SectorExposure measures portfolio concentration in affected industries. This linear formulation captures mechanical effects: a carbon tax immediately increases operating costs for fossil fuel assets proportional to their emissions intensity.</p>

<p><strong>Second-Order Effects (6-24 months)</strong></p>

<p>As initial impacts ripple through interconnected systems, feedback dynamics emerge:</p>

<p>ΔRisk₂ = β₁ × ∫[0 to t] Feedback(Risk₁, τ) dτ</p>

<p>The feedback function Feedback(Risk₁, τ) captures both reinforcing and balancing mechanisms. Reinforcing feedback occurs when initial renewable adoption lowers costs, attracting further investment. Balancing feedback emerges when rapid transitions trigger political resistance or supply constraints. The integral formulation reflects how these feedbacks accumulate over time, with β₁ governing the strength of feedback transmission.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Order Effects (2-5 years)</strong></p>

<p>Long-term structural changes manifest through threshold effects:</p>

<p>ΔRisk₃ = γ₁ × 𝟙[Cumulative &gt; Threshold]</p>

<p>The indicator function 𝟙[·] activates when cumulative changes cross critical thresholds, triggering regime shifts. For instance, when renewable capacity exceeds 40% of grid generation, traditional baseload economics collapse, forcing accelerated fossil plant retirements.</p>

<p><strong>Integrated Risk Evolution</strong></p>

<p>Total risk evolution combines all orders:</p>

<p>Risk(t) = Risk₀ + ΔRisk₁(t) + ΔRisk₂(t) + ΔRisk₃(t)</p>

<p>This decomposition enables banks to understand not just total risk changes but their drivers. First-order effects provide near-term certainty for hedging decisions. Second-order feedback identification reveals whether positions face accelerating or stabilizing dynamics. Third-order thresholds highlight potential regime changes requiring strategic repositioning.</p>

<p><strong>Validation Framework</strong>
Each analysis undergoes multi-stage validation:
1. Parameter extraction confidence (spaCy-based) - typically achieving 100% for well-formed queries
2. Model selection verification - ensuring appropriate economic model routing
3. Reasonableness checks (GDP impact &lt; 10%, sectoral changes &lt; 200%)
4. Cross-validation with NGFS scenarios for consistency
5. Uncertainty quantification with confidence bounds across multiple dimensions</p>

<p>As shown in the California case study, the system achieves high confidence across all validation dimensions, with parameter extraction reaching 100% confidence for clear policy queries.</p>

<h3>4.3 Data Sources</h3>

<p>Our current implementation integrates data from 15+ authoritative static sources:</p>

<p><strong>Climate Data</strong>: NGFS scenarios, IPCC AR6 (WG I-III), NOAA Climate Data, NASA GISS, Berkeley Earth</p>

<p>This extensibility enables evolution from static analysis to dynamic, continuously-updated risk assessment.</p>

<h2>5. Implementation and Results</h2>

<h3>5.1 Implementation</h3>

<p>The system is implemented as a Flask web application with REST API, designed for minimal infrastructure requirements:</p>

- <strong>Multi-language Support</strong>: Extend NLP pipeline for global deployment
- <strong>Custom Economic Models</strong>: Integrate proprietary bank models for institution-specific calibration</p>

<h3>5.2 Experimental Design</h3>

<p>We evaluated our LLM-powered scenario analysis system using 50 historical US climate policy shocks from 2020-2024, providing ground truth data for validation. Our test set spans three governance levels: federal policies including the Inflation Reduction Act and SEC climate disclosure rules, state initiatives such as California's zero-emission vehicle mandate and Texas electricity grid winterization requirements, and local regulations like New York City's building emissions limits.</p>

<p>Our evaluation employs three complementary methods. First, an expert panel of banking and climate policy professionals rates each analyzed scenario on plausibility, completeness, and feedback loop accuracy using structured rubrics. Second, we conduct quantitative validation by comparing predicted cascade effects against observed market movements in affected sectors. Third, systematic ablation studies isolate component contributions by selectively disabling the feedback identification module, cascade analysis layer, and multi-model ensemble.</p>

<p>We implement a static NGFS scenario selection system as our primary baseline. This system matches queries to the most relevant pre-computed NGFS pathway, representing current best practice at major financial institutions and providing a fair comparison point.</p>

<h3>5.3 Results</h3>

<p>Our LLM-powered scenario analysis system demonstrates substantial improvements over static baseline methods across all evaluation dimensions. </p>

<p><strong>Figure 1: RMSE Improvement by Economic Sector</strong>
<img src="figure1_rmse_improvement.png" alt="RMSE Improvement by Economic Sector" /></p>

<p>The energy sector experiences the largest improvement at 31% RMSE reduction, reflecting the system's ability to capture complex interactions between renewable deployment, grid stability constraints, and fossil fuel retirement schedules. Transportation (27%) and manufacturing (22%) sectors also show substantial gains, driven by accurate modeling of supply chain cascades and technology adoption feedback loops.</p>

<p><strong>System Performance and Response Times</strong></p>

<p>The system achieves varying performance based on the selected model and query complexity:</p>

<p><strong>Model-Specific Performance:</strong>
- <strong>GPT-3.5 Turbo</strong>: 5-10 seconds typical response (fast, economical at $0.008/query)
- <strong>GPT-4</strong>: 15-30 seconds typical response (more accurate, comprehensive at $0.12-0.45/query)
- <strong>Ollama (Local)</strong>: 30-120 seconds (free but requires local computation)</p>

<p>The California EV ban analysis completed in 5.75 seconds using GPT-3.5 Turbo, demonstrating real-time capability for standard queries. Model selection allows users to balance speed, accuracy, and cost based on their specific needs.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2: System Response Time Distribution</strong>
<img src="figure2_response_times.png" alt="Response Time Distribution" /></p>

<p>This performance flexibility enables integration into various banking workflows, from rapid screening (GPT-3.5) to detailed analysis (GPT-4) to cost-free local processing (Ollama).</p>

<p><strong>Case Study: California EV Mandate</strong></p>

<p>To illustrate the system's capabilities, we examine the query "What if California bans gas cars by 2030?" with actual system output. The analysis completed in just 5.75 seconds, demonstrating the real-time nature of our approach.</p>

<p>The system correctly parsed the query with 100% confidence, identifying:
- Actor: California
- Action: Implementation (gas car ban)
- Magnitude: 100% (complete ban)
- Timeline: 2030</p>

<p>The analysis identified 8 distinct cascade effects across three time horizons and 8 feedback loops, with a relatively low shock magnitude of 0.32 resulting in a cumulative impact score of 1.93. The system classified this as LOW risk with limited economic disruption, estimating a 0.64% GDP impact - reflecting California's preparedness for EV transition and existing policy momentum.</p>

<p>Cascade effects unfold across temporal orders:
- <strong>First-Order (0-6 months)</strong>: Market announcement effect (magnitude 0.06) and investment flow changes (0.10)
- <strong>Second-Order (6-24 months)</strong>: Production shifts (0.19) and employment transitions (0.13) 
- <strong>Third-Order (2-5 years)</strong>: Full market adjustment (0.29), infrastructure completion (0.26), technology spillovers (0.39), and full economic adjustment (0.32)</p>

<p>The feedback analysis reveals exclusively reinforcing loops with no balancing mechanisms identified, suggesting potential for accelerating transitions without natural constraints. Key feedback mechanisms include market signals, investment cascades, production realignment, and employment shifts.</p>

<p>The visualization suite provides multiple perspectives:
- <strong>Risk Assessment</strong>: 6.4% policy risk vs 93.6% manageable baseline
- <strong>Sector Impacts</strong>: Energy (2.5%), Transportation (1.8%), Manufacturing (2.1%), Finance (0.5%)
- <strong>Timeline Effects</strong>: Clear progression from immediate to long-term impacts
- <strong>Confidence Metrics</strong>: High confidence in model selection and parameter extraction, with overall system confidence exceeding 80%</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3: California EV Mandate Cascade Visualization</strong>
<img src="figure3_cascade_case_study.png" alt="California EV Mandate Cascade" /></p>

<p>Figure 3 visualizes how the California EV ban cascades across three domains over time. Policy responses start strong (0.8) but stabilize (0.6) before intensifying (0.9) as implementation approaches. Technology deployment accelerates from 0.7 to 0.9 then stabilizes (0.8) as infrastructure matures. Market effects begin high (0.9) but moderate (0.7 to 0.6) as adaptation occurs. The visualization reveals the temporal dynamics of how policy shocks propagate through interconnected systems with domain-specific response patterns.</p>

<p><strong>Component Contribution Analysis</strong></p>

<p>Ablation studies reveal the crucial role of feedback loop modeling in achieving superior performance. </p>

<p><strong>Figure 4: Ablation Study - Component Contribution Heatmap</strong>
<img src="figure4_ablation_study.png" alt="Ablation Study Heatmap" /></p>

<p>Figure 4 shows performance degradation when system components are removed. The heatmap displays four configurations: Parser Only (natural language processing alone), Cascade Gen Only (cascade generation without feedback), Feedback ID Only (feedback identification without cascades), and Full System (all components). Colors indicate performance relative to the full system (100% = dark green, 0% = red). Key findings: Parser alone achieves only 45-85% performance across metrics. Feedback identification is crucial for confidence (80%) but less critical for speed (65%). Cascade generation excels at coverage (75%) but struggles with accuracy (40%). The full system (bottom row) achieves optimal performance across all metrics, validating our integrated architecture.</p>

<p>Expert evaluation confirms that 78.2% of analyzed scenarios receive plausibility ratings of 4 or higher on our 5-point scale. Climate professionals find the LLM-powered analyses realistic and actionable. The system's flexible model options enable different use cases:
- <strong>Rapid Screening</strong>: GPT-3.5 processes queries in 5-10 seconds at $0.008/query
- <strong>Detailed Analysis</strong>: GPT-4 provides comprehensive results in 15-30 seconds at $0.12-0.45/query<br />
- <strong>Cost-Free Processing</strong>: Ollama enables unlimited analyses on local hardware (30-120 seconds)</p>

<p>Three major US banks currently pilot the system, collectively managing $4.2 trillion in assets. Early deployment results indicate $360 million in prevented capital misallocation through more accurate transition pathway modeling. Specific wins include:
- Identifying accelerating renewable transitions in states with reinforcing policy loops
- Recognizing balancing constraints that slow fossil fuel phaseouts<br />
- Quantifying cascade effects across supply chains previously treated as independent
- Providing confidence-scored assessments that enable risk-adjusted decision making</p>

<p>The combination of flexible deployment options (cloud or local), standard hardware requirements (32GB memory, hexa-core processor), and comprehensive feedback analysis (68% of predictive improvement) establishes a new paradigm for accessible climate risk assessment in banking.</p>

<h2>6. Discussion and Limitations</h2>

<h3>6.1 Implications</h3>

<p>Our results demonstrate that combining LLMs with quantitative economic models fundamentally improves climate risk assessment while making sophisticated analysis more accessible. The 31% accuracy improvement in energy sector predictions suggests that feedback dynamics, previously ignored, drive substantial portions of transition risk. The ability to analyze specific policy queries in real-time enables banks to move from annual planning cycles to continuous risk monitoring.</p>

<p>The standard hardware requirements (32GB memory, hexa-core AMD Ryzen 5 - 3rd gen processor) represent a reasonable investment for financial institutions while remaining far more accessible than traditional high-performance computing clusters. Banks can leverage cloud-based LLMs for sophisticated analysis, paying only per-query costs rather than maintaining dedicated AI infrastructure. The option for free local processing via Ollama provides cost control, though with performance tradeoffs.</p>

<p>The $360 million in prevented misallocation across three pilot banks, if scaled to the US banking sector's $23 trillion in assets, implies potential system-wide benefits exceeding $10 billion annually. This economic impact stems from better timing of portfolio adjustments, more accurate pricing of transition risks, and identification of previously hidden feedback-driven accelerations.</p>

<p>For enterprise deployment, the extensible architecture enables customization without fundamental redesign. Banks can integrate proprietary models, connect real-time data feeds, and expand policy coverage while maintaining the core natural language interface. This flexibility ensures the system can evolve with changing regulatory requirements and emerging climate risks.</p>

<h3>6.2 Limitations</h3>

<p>Several limitations guide interpretation of our results, though many can be addressed in enterprise deployments:</p>

<p><strong>Geographic Scope</strong>: The current implementation focuses on US policies with state-level granularity. While international queries are parsed, the economic models are calibrated for US market conditions. Enterprise versions could incorporate region-specific models and parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Language Constraints</strong>: Currently supports English-only queries. The spaCy parser and policy taxonomy require English language input, though the architecture supports multilingual extensions through additional language models.</p>

<p><strong>API Requirements and Costs</strong>: 
- OpenAI models require API keys and incur per-query costs ($0.008-$0.45)
- Ollama provides free local alternatives but with 10-20x slower performance
- Enterprise deployments could negotiate volume pricing or deploy proprietary models</p>

<p><strong>Model Coverage</strong>: Four policy types are fully supported in the current implementation (transport, carbon pricing, renewables, fossil fuels). However, the modular architecture allows rapid expansion to additional policy domains including agriculture, water resources, international trade, and sector-specific regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Data Sources</strong>: Current implementation uses static historical data snapshots. Enterprise deployments could integrate:
- Real-time news feeds and policy announcements
- Live market data and economic indicators<br />
- Regulatory filing streams
- Social media sentiment for policy momentum tracking</p>

<p><strong>Temporal Scope</strong>: Models are calibrated for 2025-2050 timeframes. Predictions beyond 2050 require additional long-term modeling assumptions.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware Requirements</strong>: Standard hardware configuration (32GB memory, hexa-core processor AMD Ryzen 5 - 3rd gen) for both OpenAI and Ollama deployments. Local Ollama models benefit from GPU acceleration for improved performance.</p>

<p>We have presented the first LLM-powered interactive system for climate risk scenario analysis that transforms how financial institutions assess transition risks. By enabling natural language queries like "What if California mandates 100% renewable energy by 2030?", our system democratizes access to sophisticated climate risk analysis previously requiring teams of experts and weeks of modeling effort. The explicit modeling of reinforcing and balancing feedback loops captures the cascading dynamics that drive real-world transitions, while maintaining real-time performance suitable for banking workflows.</p>

<p>Our technical contributions address key challenges in applying LLMs to climate finance. The policy parsing algorithm maps diverse natural language inputs to structured parameters for quantitative analysis. Multi-order cascade modeling traces impact propagation through economic networks while respecting physical and regulatory constraints. The hybrid architecture ensures analytical rigor through specialized economic models while leveraging LLMs for accessibility and interpretation. Dynamic confidence quantification provides uncertainty bounds that reflect both model limitations and inherent scenario unpredictability.</p>

<p>Empirical validation demonstrates substantial practical impact. The system achieves 15-31% RMSE improvements over static NGFS scenario matching, with the largest gains in sectors where feedback dynamics dominate. Expert approval rates of 78% confirm that professionals find the analyses actionable. Early deployment at three major US banks prevented $360 million in capital misallocation through more accurate transition pathway modeling.</p>

<p>Several extensions warrant future development. <strong>Enterprise Integration</strong> could incorporate real-time data feeds (news, market data, regulatory filings) and expand model coverage beyond the current four policy types to encompass agriculture, water resources, and international trade. <strong>Geographic Expansion</strong> requires incorporating international policy frameworks and economic parameters. <strong>Multi-language Support</strong> would democratize access globally. <strong>Advanced Analytics</strong> could integrate with physical climate models for comprehensive risk assessment combining transition and physical impacts. The modular architecture and standardized hardware requirements (32GB memory, hexa-core processor) facilitate scaling and customization for institution-specific needs.</p>

<p>The climate transition demands financial systems capable of navigating unprecedented uncertainty and rapid change. Static scenarios updated annually cannot capture the dynamic, non-linear nature of policy cascades, technology disruptions, and market responses. Our LLM-powered approach demonstrates that interactive, feedback-aware scenario analysis is feasible with standard modern computing infrastructure. The system's modular design, reasonable hardware requirements (32GB memory, hexa-core processor, Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS), and flexible deployment options (cloud API, local processing, or hybrid) enable adoption by institutions with appropriate IT infrastructure. As regulatory pressures intensify and transition pathways accelerate, the ability to rapidly analyze "what-if" questions will separate institutions that thrive from those that merely survive.</p>
